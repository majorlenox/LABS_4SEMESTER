LAB_2: Python 3.9, Creating random graphs and finding Hamiltonian cycles and Eulerian cycles  

    graph_creator.py: 
        - Creates random graph and save it in graph.bin
        Using:
            python3 graph_creator.py -V 15 -E 20 -S
            flags: 
                -V [number_of_vertexes] - how much vertexes will be in graph, by default = 10
                -E [number_of_edges]    - how much edges will be in graph, by default = random from V - 1 to 3V 
                -S                      - programm will save picture of graph in graph.png
